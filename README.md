# true-stretched valorant 

Hello, my name is Angel, but you can call me Panda 🐼. I'm 24 years old, and here's a quick summary of why I made this program: I noticed that many people were struggling with the new way to set the 4:3 resolution in Valorant 🎮. So, I created this simple program in just one hour before going to bed 🌙. It’s a “for dummies” program that makes everything super easy. With just two or three clicks, you'll have everything set up in no time! 😎

I hope you like it and would appreciate your support on social media, @panda15fps 📱. Thanks for making it this far! 🙏
